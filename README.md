# Group-4: Leaflet Package
This is our repository for Avetis, Cindy, Jesse, Caroline, and Helia.

### Contributions by group member and their assigned function:
  - *Avetis*: Used "addProviderTiles", allowing you to add third-party tiles (AKA basemamps). Used "addLayerControls", allowing the user to have an interactive UI to select which provider tiles they want to use. Used "addControl", allowing the user to add a descriptive text box to a corner of the map.
  
  - *Cindy*: Worked on "addMarkers" - uses longitude and latitude to add these makers. Used "addCircleMarkes" so that you can condense your markers into a numerical circle, allowing for zooming. Used "addEasyButton" allowing you to freeze and unfreeze circle markers.
  
  - *Jesse*: Worked on "addPolygon", giving the user the ability to highlight a given portion of the map. Then, used highlighOptions, to make the polygons interactive, giving the user hover-over tool-tips. In this case hovering over each U.S. state and Canadian province provides the state name and outlines/highlights the state/province.
  
  - *Caroline*: Worked on filtering the data in order to create a separate map that shows the data filtered by season, months, species, and time. Merged to Cindy's data and was able to create a map with these same updates with a search bar using addSearchOSM() and added additional parameters using addMeasure()
  
  - *Helia*: Created an independent chloropleth (not provided here). Giving the introduction for the presentation (libraries, leaflet, and data).
